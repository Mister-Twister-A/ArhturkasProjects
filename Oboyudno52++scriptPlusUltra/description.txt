Damn so this is a konckoff version of Brainfuck.

in syntax.txt all of the syntax of this language is listed

to run the OboyudnoLang code write in console "python ./complier.py ./[FILENAME].ðŸ¤™"

note that it takes the ascii index when using ðŸ¤™. So to output 1 you should use ðŸ¤™ on a cell with 49 in it
